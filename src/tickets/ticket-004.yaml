  A developer asks how to stop a process that is consuming too many resources.
  You're reviewing common Linux tools to terminate a process using its PID (Process ID).

  Which command should you use?

  A) kill
  B) stop
  C) shutdown
  D) break

  🔧 To solve this challenge:
  - Review the `man` pages or try the commands to see which accepts a PID and terminates a process.
  - Determine which command is specifically designed to send termination signals.
  - Once you know the correct answer, write the corresponding letter (A, B, C, or D)
    to the following file:

      /tmp/ticket-004-answer.txt

  ✍️ Example:
      echo A > /tmp/ticket-004-answer.txt

objectives:
  - The answer file /tmp/ticket-004-answer.txt must contain the letter "A"

hints:
  - You’re looking for a command that works directly with numeric PIDs.
  - `shutdown` is for powering off the system.
