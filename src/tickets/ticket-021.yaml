title: "Monitor system load using top"
difficulty: easy
question_type: command_demonstration
description: |
  You're troubleshooting a performance issue. Use the `top` command to monitor real-time CPU usage,
  and identify the most resource-intensive process. Record the PID of that process into the file
  /home/sysadmin/top-highest.pid.

objectives:
  - Use the `top` command to inspect real-time system activity.
  - Identify the most CPU-intensive process.
  - Write the PID of that process to /home/sysadmin/top-highest.pid)

hints:
  - Use `top` or `htop` to view system load.
  - Look at the `%CPU` column to find the top process.
  - Use `ps --sort=-%cpu` as an alternative.
