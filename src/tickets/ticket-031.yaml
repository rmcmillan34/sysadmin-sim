title: "Determine the default umask"
difficulty: medium
question_type: command_demonstration
description: |
  You suspect that the current shell environment is using a non-standard umask
  value, which may be exposing newly created files to unwanted access.

  Your task is to:
  1. Determine the current umask in effect
  2. Create a test file using `touch` (do not manually set permissions)
  3. Determine its permission string using `ls -l`
  4. Write the umask value and resulting permission string on the same line into:
     `/home/sysadmin/umask-check.txt`, separated by a space

  Example format: `0022 rw-r--r--`

objectives:
  - Use the `umask` command to get the current mask
  - Create a file with default permissions
  - Extract resulting permissions
  - Output both to the result file
hints:
  - `umask` without arguments shows the current value
  - `touch file && ls -l file`
  - Default umask is often `0022`
