title: "Find largest directory with du"
difficulty: medium
question_type: command_demonstration
description: |
  A web application is producing too many cache files and slowing down the server.
  The cache is located in `/var/tmp/webcache/` and contains multiple nested folders.

  Your task is to determine **which immediate subdirectory** inside `/var/tmp/webcache/`
  is using the most disk space. Write only the name of that subdirectory (not the full path)
  to `/home/sysadmin/largest-dir.txt`.

objectives:
  - Determine the largest directory by total size
  - Write only the directory name (e.g., `images`) to the result file
hints:
  - Use `du` to scan sizes of each subdirectory inside `/var/tmp/webcache`
  - Use `du -sh */` or `du -k --max-depth=1` for top-level dirs
  - Combine with `sort -hr` and `head -n 1`
