title: "Find large, old logs with find"
difficulty: medium
question_type: command_demonstration
description: |
  A cron job failed to rotate logs properly, and you suspect that some files older
  than 7 days and larger than 5MB are clogging the `/var/log/archive` directory.

  Use the `find` command to locate these files and write a list of their full paths
  into `/home/sysadmin/old-large-logs.txt`, one per line.

objectives:
  - Search `/var/log/archive` recursively
  - Identify files modified more than 7 days ago
  - Filter by size greater than 5MB
  - Output a newline-separated list to the result file
hints:
  - Use `-mtime +7` and `-size +5M`
  - Use `find /var/log/archive -type f ...`
