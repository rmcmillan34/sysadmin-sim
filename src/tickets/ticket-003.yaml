title: "Changing Process Priority"
difficulty: medium
question_type: multiple_choice
description: |
  A process on your system is using too many CPU resources. You want to reduce its priority
  without terminating it. Which command allows you to adjust the nice value of a running process?

  A) renice  
  B) ps  
  C) pkill  
  D) top

  🔧 To solve this challenge:
  - Review the `man` pages for each command listed.
  - Identify the command used to *modify* the nice value of a process that's already running.
  - Once you know the correct answer, write the corresponding letter (A, B, C, or D)
    to the following file:

      /home/sysadmin/ticket-003-answer.txt

  ✍️ Example:
      echo A > /home/sysadmin/ticket-003-answer.txt

objectives:
  - The answer file /home/sysadmin/ticket-003-answer.txt must contain the letter "A"

hints:
  - Look for a command that adjusts priority of running processes.
  - `nice` is for starting new processes, not modifying existing ones.
