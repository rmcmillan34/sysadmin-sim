title: "Adjust process priority with nice"
difficulty: medium
question_type: command_demonstration
description: |
  The 'slowtask' process is running with a low priority, causing it to be preempted by other processes.
  Use the `nice` command to change the priority of the 'slowtask' process to a nice value of 5.
  Verify the change using `ps` or `top`.

objectives:
  - Use the `nice` command to change the priority of the 'slowtask' process to a nice value of 5.
  - Verify the process priority has been updated using `ps` or `top`.
hints:
  - Use `ps -o nice= -p PID` to check the current nice value.
  - Use `nice -n 5 command` to set the nice value when starting a process.
  - Use `renice` to change the priority of a running process.
