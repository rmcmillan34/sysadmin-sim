title: "Check file metadata with stat"
difficulty: easy
question_type: command_demonstration
description: |
  A user reports that the configuration file located at `/etc/sysadmin-sim/test.conf`
  may have been modified recently. Your task is to use `stat` to determine the fileâ€™s
  last modification time, and record it in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` into:
  `/home/sysadmin/stat-result.txt`.

objectives:
  - Use the `stat` command to extract the last modification time of the file.
  - Format the output and write only the timestamp to `/home/sysadmin/stat-result.txt`.
hints:
  - Use `stat -c %y /path/to/file` to get the mod time.
  - Consider using `cut` to trim off unnecessary parts.
