title: "Capture System Load with uptime"
difficulty: easy
question_type: command_demonstration
description: |
  A senior admin asks you to quickly report the current system uptime and load averages over the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes.

  Your task:
  - Use the `uptime` command to capture system uptime and load averages.
  - Save the output into the following file:

      /home/sysadmin/uptime_load_output.txt

  🔧 To solve this challenge:
  - Use the `uptime` command without options to get system uptime and load averages.
  - Redirect the output to the specified file.

  ✍️ Example command:
      uptime > /home/sysadmin/uptime_load_output.txt

objectives:
  - The file /home/sysadmin/uptime_load_output.txt must exist and contain system load averages.

hints:
  - Look for three numbers at the end of the `uptime` output — those are load averages.
  - Load averages show the number of runnable processes.
