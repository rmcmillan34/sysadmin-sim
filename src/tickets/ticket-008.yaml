  You're tuning a system's scheduler settings and are asked about valid `nice` values.

  What is the valid range of nice values in Linux?

  A) 0 to 20  
  B) -20 to 19  
  C) -5 to 5  
  D) 1 to 10

  🔧 To solve this challenge:
  - Check the documentation for `nice` and `renice`.
  - Identify the full range of nice values that Linux supports.
  - Once you know the correct answer, write the corresponding letter (A, B, C, or D)
    to the following file:

      /tmp/ticket-008-answer.txt

  ✍️ Example:
      echo B > /tmp/ticket-008-answer.txt

objectives:
  - The answer file /tmp/ticket-008-answer.txt must contain the letter "B"

hints:
  - The lower the value, the higher the priority.
  - Values can be negative for higher-priority processes.
