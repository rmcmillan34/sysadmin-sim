title: "Demonstrate CPU Monitoring with top"
difficulty: easy
question_type: command_demonstration
description: |
  A junior administrator needs to monitor live CPU usage by processes.

  Your task:
  - Run the `top` command.
  - Identify the top 5 processes consuming the most CPU.
  - Save the output of the top 5 processes into the following file:

      /tmp/top_cpu_output.txt

  🔧 To solve this challenge:
  - Use `top` or similar tool to view running processes.
  - Sort if necessary (hint: press 'P' to sort by CPU in `top`).
  - Use `head` or `awk` if you need to filter down to 5 lines.
  - Redirect the output into `/tmp/top_cpu_output.txt`.

  ✍️ Example commands:
      top -b -n 1 | head -20 > /tmp/top_cpu_output.txt

objectives:
  - The file /tmp/top_cpu_output.txt must exist and contain CPU usage information.

hints:
  - Use `man top` to understand how to run it in batch mode.
  - Use `top` in batch mode (`top -b -n 1`) to capture output.
  - Use `head` or `awk` to extract just the top few lines.
  - Make sure the output includes process information, not just headers.
