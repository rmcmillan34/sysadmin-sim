title: "Terminate a Process with kill"
difficulty: medium
question_type: command_demonstration
description: |
  A service has hung and is consuming too many system resources.

  Your task:
  - Identify any process related to `sleep 300`.
  - Terminate the process cleanly using the `kill` command.
  - Record the PID of the terminated process into the following file:

      /tmp/kill_pid_output.txt

  üîß To solve this challenge:
  - You may launch a dummy process yourself by running `sleep 300 &`.
  - Use `ps` to find the PID.
  - Use `kill` with the appropriate PID.
  - Write the killed PID into `/tmp/kill_pid_output.txt` after termination.

  ‚úçÔ∏è Example commands:
      sleep 300 &  
      ps aux | grep sleep  
      kill <PID>  
      echo <PID> > /tmp/kill_pid_output.txt

objectives:
  - The file /tmp/kill_pid_output.txt must exist and contain the PID that was terminated.

hints:
  - Use `ps aux | grep sleep` to find the process easily.
  - Verify the process no longer exists after using `kill`.
