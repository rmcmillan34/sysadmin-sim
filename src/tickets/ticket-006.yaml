  Which of the following commands provides a static snapshot of currently running processes?

  A) ps
  B) jobs
  C) kill
  D) free

  🔧 To solve this challenge:

  - You’re not looking for memory usage, background jobs, or signal-based commands.
  - Once you know the correct answer, write the corresponding letter (A, B, C, or D)
    to the following file:

      /tmp/ticket-006-answer.txt

  ✍️ Example:
      echo A > /tmp/ticket-006-answer.txt

objectives:
  - The answer file /tmp/ticket-006-answer.txt must contain the letter "A"

hints:
  - `ps aux` is often used to see all active processes.
  - This command is not interactive like `top`.
