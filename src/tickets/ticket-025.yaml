title: "Identify file types using file"
difficulty: easy
question_type: command_demonstration
description: |
  Several mysterious files have been found in `/var/sysadmin-sim/mystery/`.
  Use the `file` command to determine which file is a shell script,
  and record its filename into `/home/sysadmin/shellscript.txt`.

objectives:
  - Use `file` to inspect files and identify a shell script.
  - Write only the name of the shell script to the output file.
hints:
  - Run `file *` inside the directory to see types.
  - Look for a file described as “Bourne-Again shell script”.
