title: "Create a timestamped file with touch"
difficulty: easy
question_type: command_demonstration
description: |
  You’ve been asked to prepare a system marker for a backup event.
  Use the `touch` command to create an empty file named `backup.marker`
  inside the directory `/home/sysadmin/markers/`.
  Ensure the timestamp on the file reflects the current time.

objectives:
  - Create a file named `backup.marker` in `/home/sysadmin/markers/`.
  - Ensure it has a recent timestamp (within the last 2 minutes).
hints:
  - Use `mkdir` first to create the directory if it doesn’t exist.
  - Use `touch /path/to/file` to create or update timestamp.
