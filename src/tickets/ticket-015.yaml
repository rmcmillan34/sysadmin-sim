title: "Monitor Memory Usage with free"
difficulty: easy
question_type: command_demonstration
description: |
  You need to check the system's available and used memory.

  Your task:
  - Use the `free` command to display memory statistics.
  - Capture the output into the following file:

      /tmp/free_memory_output.txt

  🔧 To solve this challenge:
  - Use `free -h` to display memory usage in human-readable format (MB, GB).
  - Redirect the output into the specified file.

  ✍️ Example command:
      free -h > /tmp/free_memory_output.txt

objectives:
  - The file /tmp/free_memory_output.txt must exist and contain memory statistics.

hints:
  - The `-h` option for `free` makes the output easier to read.
  - Look for fields like "total", "used", and "free" memory.
