title: "Search logs using grep"
difficulty: medium
question_type: command_demonstration
description: |
  A support engineer needs to identify when a simulated service failure occurred.
  Use `grep` to search the log file `/var/log/sysadmin-sim/failure.log` for lines containing the string "ERROR".
  Save only the number of matching lines to `/home/sysadmin/error-count.txt`.

objectives:
  - Use `grep` to search for the term "ERROR" in a file.
  - Count the number of matches and write the count to a file.
hints:
  - Try `grep -c` to get a count of matching lines.
  - Use `wc -l` if using `grep` without `-c`.
