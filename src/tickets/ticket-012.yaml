title: "Process Scheduling Priorities"
difficulty: medium
question_type: multiple_choice
description: |
  You're tuning system performance by adjusting process priorities.

  Which of the following best describes how Linux treats processes with lower nice values?

  A) They receive less CPU time.  
  B) They are scheduled earlier and receive more CPU time.  
  C) They are paused until high-nice processes finish.  
  D) They are automatically assigned to background tasks.

  🔧 To solve this challenge:
  - Review what lower nice values mean in terms of CPU priority.
  - Once you know the correct answer, write the corresponding letter (A, B, C, or D)
    to the following file:

      /tmp/ticket-012-answer.txt

  ✍️ Example:
      echo A > /tmp/ticket-012-answer.txt

objectives:
  - The answer file /tmp/ticket-012-answer.txt must contain the letter "B"

hints:
  - Nice values affect CPU scheduling priority.
  - A lower nice value means "less nice" = more aggressive CPU usage.
