title: "List Active Processes with ps"
difficulty: easy
question_type: command_demonstration
description: |
  A junior admin wants to see all active processes running on the system, including full details like UID, PID, CPU, and memory usage.

  Your task:
  - Use the `ps` command to list all currently running processes.
  - Capture the full output into the following file:

      /home/sysadmin/ps_full_output.txt

  🔧 To solve this challenge:
  - Use options with `ps` to show extended information about all processes.
  - Write the output directly into the specified file.

  ✍️ Example commands:
      ps aux > /home/sysadmin/ps_full_output.txt

objectives:
  - The file /home/sysadmin/ps_full_output.txt must exist and contain detailed process information.

hints:
  - Use `ps aux` to show all processes with full details.
  - Remember to redirect the output using `>`.
