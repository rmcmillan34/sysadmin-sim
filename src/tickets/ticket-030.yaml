title: "Lock down insecure file permissions"
difficulty: easy
question_type: command_demonstration
description: |
  A log file has been found in `/var/log/audit/` with insecure permissions
  that allow any user to modify it.

  Your task is to change the permissions on `audit.log` to `rw-r--r--` using the
  appropriate command. Do not change ownership or move the file.

  When you're done, write the new permissions (in symbolic form) into the file:
  `/home/sysadmin/audit-perms.txt`.

objectives:
  - Use chmod to change the file to -rw-r--r--
  - Leave ownership and group untouched
  - Write the permission string (e.g. rwxrw-r--) to the result file
hints:
  - Use `ls -l` to check the permissions
  - Use `chmod 644 /path/to/file` to fix it
