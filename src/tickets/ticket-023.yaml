title: "Locate system logs using find"
difficulty: medium
question_type: command_demonstration
description: |
  A developer has lost track of several important log files that end in `.log`.
  Search the `/var/sysadmin-sim/logs` directory and all its subdirectories for
  files that end with `.log`. Record the number of files you find into
  `/home/sysadmin/log-count.txt`.

objectives:
  - Use the `find` command to search for files ending with `.log`.
  - Count the number of matching files and write the count to a file.
hints:
  - Use `find /path -type f -name '*.log'`
  - Use `wc -l` to count results, or `find -printf . | wc -c`
