  You're troubleshooting a performance issue on a Linux server.
  Which command would you use to view a summary of current RAM usage?

  A) free
  B) df
  C) du

  - Identify the tool that shows total, used, and free memory (RAM).
  - Once you know the correct answer, write the corresponding letter (A, B, C, or D)
    to the following file:

      /tmp/ticket-002-answer.txt

  ✍️ Example:
      echo A > /tmp/ticket-002-answer.txt

objectives:

hints:
  - You're not looking for disk space or uptime.
  - `free` is your friend for memory snapshots.
