  You want to stop a process by its name rather than its PID.

  Which of the following commands is used to terminate a process by name?

  A) pkill
  B) kill
  C) top
  D) ps

  🔧 To solve this challenge:
  - Use `man` pages to compare how `kill` and `pkill` behave.
  - Try running a background process and see which tool works using only the process name.
  - Once you know the correct answer, write the corresponding letter (A, B, C, or D)
    to the following file:

      /home/sysadmin/ticket-009-answer.txt

  ✍️ Example:
      echo A > /home/sysadmin/ticket-009-answer.txt

objectives:
  - The answer file /home/sysadmin/ticket-009-answer.txt must contain the letter "A"

hints:
  - `kill` needs a PID, `pkill` uses the name.
  - Don't confuse `ps` or `top` with signal commands.
