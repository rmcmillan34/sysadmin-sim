  You need to display the parent/child relationships between running processes in a tree-like format.

  Which command would you use?

  A) ps  
  B) pstree  
  C) top  
  D) kill

  🔧 To solve this challenge:
  - Review each command by using `man` pages or trying them.
  - Find the command that shows a graphical process tree structure.
  - Once you know the correct answer, write the corresponding letter (A, B, C, or D)
    to the following file:

      /tmp/ticket-010-answer.txt

  ✍️ Example:
      echo B > /tmp/ticket-010-answer.txt

objectives:
  - The answer file /tmp/ticket-010-answer.txt must contain the letter "B"

hints:
  - One command outputs a tree where parents and children are visually connected.
  - `ps` gives a flat list; `pstree` gives a hierarchy.
