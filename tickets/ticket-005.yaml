  You need to check the system load averages over the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes to determine if it's under heavy CPU stress.

  Which command provides this information?

  A) htop
  B) top
  C) uptime
  D) netstat

  🔧 To solve this challenge:
  - Try running each command and see which one includes load average data.
  - Look for the command that displays three load values as part of its standard output.
  - Once you know the correct answer, write the corresponding letter (A, B, C, or D)
    to the following file:

      /home/sysadmin/ticket-005-answer.txt

  ✍️ Example:
      echo C > /home/sysadmin/ticket-005-answer.txt

objectives:
  - The answer file /home/sysadmin/ticket-005-answer.txt must contain the letter "C"

hints:
  - Load averages are typically shown alongside uptime and user count.
  - You’re not looking for interactive process viewers.
