  You want to interactively sort, filter, and monitor system processes in real-time.

  Which command provides this functionality?

  A) top
  B) watch
  C) less
  D) grep

  🔧 To solve this challenge:
  - Try each command and observe which one shows a constantly updating list of processes.
  - Look for a command that supports keyboard shortcuts like `k` or `q`.
  - Once you know the correct answer, write the corresponding letter (A, B, C, or D)
    to the following file:

      /home/sysadmin/ticket-007-answer.txt

  ✍️ Example:
      echo A > /home/sysadmin/ticket-007-answer.txt

objectives:
  - The answer file /home/sysadmin/ticket-007-answer.txt must contain the letter "A"

hints:
  - `top` is commonly used by sysadmins to view live process usage.
  - `watch` just repeats other commands.
